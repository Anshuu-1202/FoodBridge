## 🌟 Why FoodBridge?

> 🚨 **40%** of food produced is wasted — while **1 in 9** people go hungry.  
> 🏪 Restaurants and grocers discard edible food due to logistical gaps.  
> 🙋 Volunteers want to help but lack tools for coordination.

**FoodBridge** solves this by building a real-time, AI-powered platform for food recovery and redistribution — optimized for hyperlocal impact.
